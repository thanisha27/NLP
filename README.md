**Fake Review Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

-Improved fake review detection techniques are required as a result of the rise in fraudulent online reviews. In this study we compare and analyze the effectiveness of various models using two datasets: The Amazon Fake Review Detection Dataset and the Fake Review Detection Dataset. The Amazon Fake Review Detection Dataset is a collection of reviews useful to differentiate between genuine and fake reviews, while the Fake Review Detection Dataset is a collection of reviews from various online platforms. Various machine learning, and deep learning techniques are used to analyze textual content, linguistic patterns, and behavioral cues in both the datasets. Machine learning algorithms are used to find out distinct features and patterns indicating fake reviews, while natural language processing extracts semantic meaning, sentiment, and syntactic structures. Deep learning methodologies capture intricate relationships within the data, enabling a detailed understanding of fake review characteristics. The study evaluates selected models using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy, and investigates the impact of dataset characteristics on performance. Using this study we compare machine learning with deep learning models and find out which model better predicts the fake reviews. The study's findings help enhance methods for identifying fraudulent reviews, which raises the credibility of online feedback and empowers users to make wiser judgments based on real comments.
